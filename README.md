The original paper used logistic regression using backwards selection on a number of binary variables
to attempt to predict the risk of childhood mortality. It created a simple binary risk score to aid
in calculating a child's probability of death.

My work attempts to extend this analysis by using machine learning analyses to validate this approach
and compare it to other analytical methods. In particular, I aim to produce some decision trees to aid in 
decision-making.
